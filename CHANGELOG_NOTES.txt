v4.1.2



Conversion to C++
-----------------
This was done for both speed, and to help me learn C++, for future projects and updates.
This change will occur to almost every file in pyTGM, slowly over time.


psound
------
psound is now a C++ function.
It has become a lot more complicated though.


Extra notes
-----------
v4.1.2 has the shortest change list... of ACTUAL updates. Some previous versions
were an attempt to fix an import error, because I accidentally released an
untested version. Now, I test the versions before release. And, the user base for pyTGM has been growing.
Currently, at the time of release, there are 41 known users.
The biggest bug I know of so far is that terd.click() detects all over the screen, rather than just characters inside the terminal.
pyTGM is shaping up to be of some pretty good quality.
