v4.1.1



Warnings fix
------------
The warnings used to not show, if it caught an error
I fixed it, by adding a finally after the try and excepts


b64 and sha256
--------------
Originally, I had plans for adding sha256, but I eventually deleted it,
way back in v2. But now, I have added it, and I'm glad I waited to do it,
because I organized things a lot, and I've learned so much...


winsound
--------
Before this change, it would always check if you used windows, as soon
as you imported it, and every time you used it.
This won't last long though, I will soon be making sound a C++ function.

Extra notes
-----------
v4.1.1 has a couple of changes, most of them are for organization,
to compensate for the adding or removing of functions.
It's somewhat to help prepare pyTGM, and it's users for v4.2.0

I've never used warnings before, before, I would make the change, and
then label it as a minor change, when removing it is a major breaking change.
But, now I know better, to look at what actualy changed, rather than how big
the changelog for the version is. I am also getting better at deciding
what's worth actually putting inside the changelog.

Also, v4.0.1 - v4.0.6 were released, because I didn't do what I do now;
Run the code on my computer and a VM, to make sure it works. So, most of
those versions worked with windows, and nothing else. On top of that,
v4.0.4 was a near exact copy of v4.0.3, and I couldn't reupload a file,
 under the same version, only delete it. So that led to some complications.
