-----
hk512 is also known as HexKey512, because it uses base512 (A custom base encoding), hex numbers, and a key.
A hex number is not the only thing though, it also uses stuff like octal numbers and binary.
And, on top of that, the binary gets flipped before anything happpens to it!

Removing Click
--------------
This decision wasn't what I wanted, however, majority of terminals don't support mouse clicks.
This function may one day come back, if mouse clicks are standard, or if I find another way to implement it.
My other option is a ton of advanced calulations, getting temrinal character size, mouse input, area of terminal
and, figuring out where the mouse click was.

Conversion to C++
-----------------
More and more is coming to C++
Not all of it is done by me. Like file.
I tried to convert it to C++, but I'm just not advanced enough yet. I hope, that one day, I can improve it though.
Eventually, I hope there is a community of programmers, who show their appreciation, and help improve it, or give ideas, if they can.
I prefer to make tools, not games, but, this is an easier way to introduce yourself to programming!

Conversion to Cython
--------------------
I didn't REALLY want to do this, but, pybind11 was giving errors, and I never noticed...
Not untill WAY later in 5.0.0 development. Now, I have to go through the pain of conversion,
and the scary... FILE SIZE EXPANSION!! (It truly is scary...)
But, if it works, it has to be done.


Extra notes
-----------
This version is the one I'm most proud of. It shows that I'm learning C++. Even though, not all of it was done by me.
It also shows my dedecation.
It's like seeing your child grow up. And yes. I do consider this my child, born of mind.
I first sketched it out on a notepad. It had TONS of extra stuff...
Sadly though, this version took forever, because I took a break, to learn C# and Unity, to
make a game called cool_man.exp (Still in development!)
And, I also lost interest in programming... for a week...
Now, I can't stop programming!
Also, I got a job to make a website, slowing development even MORE...

I am also more keen on developing tools instead of game makers!
But, this is still an AMAZING project, and it let's me learn C++ too!
And, the plans are, that by 7.0.0 this is a 100% C++ library!
Hopefully, by then, people also use it more!

Because for some reason... PEOPLE JUST CLONE AND CLONE!!
I've had a max of 178 clones and a minimum of 32 clones...
THATS CRAZY!

But now, low and behold... pyTGM 5.0.0!!
The latest and greatest (As of Febuary th, 2025)

I wonder what my guinea pigs think about it...
They probably like it cause I'm around them more, and I clean their cage every couple of hours!
