-----
hk512 is also known as HexKey512, because it uses base512 (A custom base encoding), hex numbers, and a key.
A hex number is not the only thing though, it also uses stuff like octal numbers and binary.
And, on top of that, the binary gets flipped before anything happpens to it!

Removing Click
--------------
This decision wasn't what I wanted, however, majority of terminals don't support mouse clicks.
This function may one day come back, if mouse clicks are standard, or if I find another way to implement it.
My other option is a ton of advanced calulations, getting temrinal character size, mouse input, area of terminal
and, figuring out where the mouse click was.

Conversion to C++
-----------------
More and more is coming to C++
Not all of it is done by me. Like file.
I tried to convert it to C++, but I'm just not advanced enough yet. I hope, that one day, I can improve it though.
Eventually, I hope there is a community of programmers, who show their appreciation, and help improve it, or give ideas, if they can.
I prefer to make tools, not games, but, this is an easier way to introduce yourself to programming!

Conversion to nanobind
----------------------
This conversion has gone through three attempts...
Cmake is the only consitent thing.
It has made me genuinley consider handing this off to somebody, or just archiving pyTGM...
BUT, because I have new found love for programming, and my interest are begining to broaden again, I have decided to continue.
kore daisuki. It translates to "I love this"
Programming is my passion.
Tech is my love.
I will never think of giving my baby (pyTGM) up EVER again.
I enjoy having software people interact with and use.
Programming is who I am.
I have a new-found passion for this. More than can be described in the words I have available to me...


Extra notes
-----------
This version is the one I'm most proud of. It shows that I'm learning C++. Even though, not all of it was done by me.
It also shows my dedecation.
It's like seeing your child grow up. And yes. I do consider this my child, born of mind.
I first sketched it out on a notepad. It had TONS of extra stuff...
Sadly though, this version took forever, because I took a break, to learn C# and Unity, to
make a game called cool_man.exp (Still in development!)
And, I also lost interest in programming... for a week...
Now, I can't stop programming!
Also, I got a job to make a website, slowing development even MORE...

I am also more keen on developing tools instead of game makers!
But, this is still an AMAZING project, and it let's me learn C++ too!
And, the plans are, that by 7.0.0 this is a 100% C++ library!
Hopefully, by then, people also use it more!

Because for some reason... PEOPLE JUST CLONE AND CLONE!!
I've had a max of 178 clones and a minimum of 32 clones...
THATS CRAZY!

But now, low and behold... pyTGM 5.0.0!!
The latest and greatest (As of 2025)!

I wonder what my guinea pigs think about it...
They probably like it cause I'm around them more, and I clean their cage every couple of hours!

I also don't modify the extra notes, so it acts more as a timeline, and less of a summary.
Or atleast.. I usually don't.
I love to program. It is who I am. The abstract of it.
The difference from spoken language and programming language.
They are different.
Language is stuck as it is. Innefficient, so our feeble minds can understand the slow processing of sounds.
It truly is an interesting thing...
Technology, language, the brain, AI, and programming.
The computer understands mov 0xf4001 as a command. The average non-programming brain doesn't.
The human brain, and other animal brains take time to process, to connect.
We are just a giant powerful LLM.
To program is to fix what is broken and improve what you %500 know what you're doing.
Not %100, %500. Or you'll break it.
Even then, programming isn't as hard as people think it is.
It's projects like these that people meet, and then they determine this is how all code is...
But, you build up to this, and this has been in development for nearly 2 years now, and its on v5,
because I was looking for a way to make it more efficient, more practical and more useful.

Because in practice, there's a lot that people wouldn't really use, or have a simpler way to do it,
nativley in Python.

And sadly, development took FOREVER.
